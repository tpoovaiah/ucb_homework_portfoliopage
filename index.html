She has worked on several freelance projects, including an original piece for episode 5 the YouTube series “My Personal Code,” map levels for the indie game "Halus" by Qalang, and an advertisement for the app “Hound” by SoundHound, Inc.

                    Tanya loves to tell unique stories with an unexpected twist, and delights in making people laugh. Creating characters that are honest and sincere, and telling stories that resonate with people, is what drives her. Tanya is passionate about art, education, technology, and innovation.

                    <br>
                    When she’s not animating, you can often find Tanya practicing martial arts, playing the piano, or teaching herself to play the guitar. Tanya also enjoys traveling, cooking (more like experimenting!) and video games.
